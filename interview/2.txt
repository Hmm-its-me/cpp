Supervised learning algorithms are trained using labeled data.
Unsupervised learning algorithms are trained using unlabeled data. => Clustering.
Grouping unlabeled examples is called clustering.


Regression models will be trained to understand the
relationship between different independent variables and an outcome. 

Most common use of regression analysis in business is for forecasting
future opportunities and threats.  Demand analysis, for example, forecasts the amount of
things a customer is likely to buy.

-> Simple Linear Regression
Plots a st.line within data points to minimize the error. The relationship between 
the independent(X) and dependent variables(Y) is assumed to be linear in this case.
Outliers are common because of best line of fit.
Y = aX + b;
- Real Estate prediction
- Salary vs experience prediction.
- Sales Estimates.


-> Multiple Linear Regression
Ex: Polynomial Regression, curve line fitted to the data points.
Used when Multiple independent variables are involved
Multiple variabels might have the same degree.


Polynomial Regression
Models the non-linear data set. by finding a best fit non-linear curve.
Y= b0+b1x+ b2x^2+ b3x^3+.....+ bnx^n.
X => Input or independent variable.
Single varibale with Multiple degrees.



-> Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is used when the dependent variable can have values like true or false;
success or failure. 
Generally A sigmoid curve is used to plot the relationship between dependent and independent 
varialbes.
we have dependent variables in a binary or discrete format such as 0 or 1.

f(x) = 1/+e^(-x);

Binary (T/F, pass/fail), Multi (diff animals)
