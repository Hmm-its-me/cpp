Sometimes the program should read a whole input line, possibly containing spaces.
This can be accomplished by using the getline function:

string s;
getline(cin, s);


If the amount of data is unknown, the following loop is useful:

while(cin >> x)
{
    // code...
}

Usually contest problems are set so that the type long long is enough. Still, it
is good to know that the g++ compiler also provides a 128-bit type  
__int128_t
with a value range of [−2^(127)... 2^(127) − 1] (about −10^38 ... 10^38).


In C++ and other languages, the remainder of a negative number is either zero or negative.
An easy way to make sure there are no negative remainders is to first calculate the
remainder as usual and then add m if the result is negative:

x = x%m;
if (x < 0) x += m;  Where generally m is = mod that is => 10^9 + 7;
